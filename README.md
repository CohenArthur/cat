# cat
A simple cat implementation with a GNU FastÂ® aligned buffer

The source code should be relatively self-explanatory.

GNU's implementation:
```
yuuko@navi ~/git/cat $ valgrind cat cat.c nonexistent_file cat.c >/dev/null

My implementation
```

As you can see, I have GNU cat beaten in memory footprint. However,
```
yuuko@navi ~/Downloads $ du -sh 9front-4308.4e3f4e43246e.iso 
537M	9front-4308.4e3f4e43246e.iso
```
GNU's implementation:
```
yuuko@navi ~/Downloads $ time cat 9front-4308.4e3f4e43246e.iso >/dev/null

real	0m0.479s
user	0m0.010s
sys	0m0.467s
```
My implementation:
```
yuuko@navi ~/Downloads $ time ~/git/cat/cat 9front-4308.4e3f4e43246e.iso >/dev/null

real	0m0.703s
user	0m0.246s
sys	0m0.455s
```
As you can see, unfortunately, GNU still has me beat on speed. I get results like these pretty consistently, with both compiled with GCC at -O2. Future directions, therefore, are chiefly optimization.
